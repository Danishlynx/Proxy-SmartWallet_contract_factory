# Smart Wallet Contracts

## Overview
This project contains Solidity smart contracts for a Smart Wallet system. It includes a `SmartWallet` contract that allows users to manage their funds securely and a `SmartWalletProxy` contract for creating and managing individual `SmartWallet` instances per user.

## Features
- Create and destroy personal wallet contracts on demand.
- Deposit and withdraw funds.
- Smart contract ownership and authorization management.

2. Install dependencies:
cd [project-directory]
npm install

javascript
Copy code

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory with the following contents:

## Deploying Contracts
To deploy the SmartWalletProxy contract, run:
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network-name]

vbnet
Copy code

## Interacting with Contracts
You can interact with the contracts using Hardhat or by integrating them into a frontend application using libraries such as `ethers.js` or `web3.js`.

### Creating a Wallet
Call the `createWallet` function on the SmartWalletProxy contract:
```javascript
const tx = await smartWalletProxy.createWallet();
await tx.wait();
Destroying a Wallet
Call the destroyWallet function on your SmartWallet instance:

javascript
Copy code
const tx = await smartWallet.destroyWallet();
await tx.wait();
javascript
Copy code

### `CONFIGURATION.md`

# Configuration Guide

## Hardhat Configuration (`hardhat.config.js`)
This file contains the Hardhat network configuration, compiler settings, and other project-specific settings.

### Network Configuration
To deploy contracts to different networks (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Ropsten, Rinkeby), configure the network settings in `hardhat.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    ropsten: {
      url: `https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/${process.env.INFURA_API_KEY}`,
      accounts: [`0x${process.env.PRIVATE_KEY}`]
    }
  },
  solidity: "0.8.0",
};
Ensure your .env file contains the INFURA_API_KEY and PRIVATE_KEY for the network you intend to use.

Environment Variables
The .env file should include:

PRIVATE_KEY: Your Ethereum private key without the 0x prefix.
INFURA_API_KEY: Your Infura project API key for accessing Ethereum networks.
